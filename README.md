## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge submission.

This project was an excellent opportunity to improve my coding skills by building a realistic project, focusing on creating a multi-step form with various technologies.

### Technologies Used:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **SASS**
- **Formik**
- **Yup**
- **Next.js**

### Project Duration:

Approximately 2.5 days

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build out a multi-step form, ensuring it closely resembles the provided design. The goal was to create an efficient and user-friendly form, taking into consideration various user interactions and validations.

### Key Features:

- Users can complete each step of the form sequence.
- Ability to go back and update selections in previous steps.
- A summary of selections is available on the final step for confirmation.
- Responsive design for optimal layout on different screen sizes.
- Interactive elements with hover and focus states.
- Form validation using Yup for scenarios like missed fields or incorrect email formats.

## Implementation Approach

I started by setting up the project environment with Next.js, integrating TypeScript for type safety and SASS for styling. Formik was instrumental in managing the form state, and Yup provided a seamless way to implement validations.

Each step of the form was carefully crafted to ensure a smooth user experience, with the ability to navigate back and forth between steps without losing data. The responsive design was meticulously tested to ensure functionality across various devices.

## Project Deployment

The project was deployed using Vercel, providing a live demonstration of the multi-step form. This deployment showcases the interactive elements, responsive design, and the overall functionality of the form.

## Reflections and Learnings

This challenge was a valuable learning experience, particularly in managing complex form states and validations. It also provided practical experience in using a combination of React, TypeScript, SASS, Formik, Yup, and Next.js in a real-world project scenario.

The project's codebase is available on my GitHub repository for review and feedback. I welcome any suggestions or comments to further improve the project.

**Enjoy exploring the multi-step form!** ðŸš€
